## Task 1
--Created `arrayManipulation.js` and wrote a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers.

--It returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2
--Added a function `formatArrayStrings` in `arrayManipulation.js` that takes an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`.

--It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizesthe string if the number is even, and converts it to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3
--Created `userInfo.js` and wrote a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.

--It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).

## Task 4
--Added this `README.md` file with my student ID and a brief explanation of each task.
